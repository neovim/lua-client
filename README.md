lua-client (DEPRECATED)
=======================

lua-client is now part of Nvim core: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/d6279f9392073cb1422d76c57baf3fd283ed954e

1. Nvim can now run Lua scripts via `nvim -l <script>`.
2. The Lua client [runs the Nvim test suite](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/d6279f9392073cb1422d76c57baf3fd283ed954e).
3. The legacy lua-client (this repo) is no longer needed.
